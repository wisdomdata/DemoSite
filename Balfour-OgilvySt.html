                    <p>
                    Elaine Balfour-Ogilvy, or Laine as she was known to her friends, was the daughter of the well known
	Renmark pioneering family. Trained as a nurse at the
	Adelaide Children’s Hospital, she enlisted in 1940 in
	the AANS 2/4th Casualty Clearing Station.
                    </p>
                    In 1942, as the Japanese advanced down the Malay
	Peninsula, Lanie spent long hard hours tending
	to badly wounded soldiers amid bombings and
	danger. In these extreme conditions, her joy and
	strong Christian character won the admiration of
	her colleagues. Lanie cheered many a heart with the
	delightful sweetness of her singing.
                    <p>
                    When the fall of Singapore was imminent, most
	nurses were evacuated, but a few, including Lanie
	assisted to the last before loading children and injured men onto a small
	coastal steamer, the Vyner Brooke. On the 14th February, the enemy bombed
	and sank the steamer. Lanie who learned to swim in the Murray, swam to a
	rope trailing from a lifeboat and assisted and encouraged others.
	Several hours later, between forty to eighty survivors including Lanie, had
	reached shore. She and twenty one other nurses tended to the needy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Two days later, the group had split and those that remained decided to surrender.
	They were met by Japanese soldiers who took the men behind a bluff. The
	soldiers returned wiping their bayonets ... the nurses were then made to
	walk into the sea and as they did, were shot from behind.
                    </p>
                    <h2></h2>
                    <h4></h4>
                    <p>
                    Appropriately, the longest north-south road in the Loxton Settlement and
	a wing in the Renmark Municipal Library recognise this young, beautiful,
	laughing Riverlander who died so tragically aged just thirty.
