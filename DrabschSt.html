                    <h1>Drabsch Street</h1>
				  	<h2>Adolph Wilhelm Robert (AWR) Drabsch, <em>‘The Father of Loxton’</em></h2>
					<img src="img/AWR_Drabsch_portrait.png" alt="AWR Drabsch portrait portrait"/>

                    <p>
                    AWR Drabsch, born 3rd September 1865 at Woodside,
      married Ernestine Quast in 1890 at Mannum where
      he farmed and managed the Allgemeiner Deutscher
      Verein, (later the Mannum Club). He became one of the first farmer-settlers in Loxton, first through leasing in 1895
      then, (with brothers Reinhold, Paul and John) purchasing land in 1897. His brother John and his wife Ida were Loxton’s long-
      serving postmasters.
                    </p>
					<p>
                    AWR was a natural leader with considerable business
      acumen. A spokesman for the growing town, his
      character and sense of public duty laid foundation for
      Loxton’s strong community spirit today. His guidance
      led to proclamation of the town on forty allotments
      from Drabsch farmland in 1907. In 1910, he became
      first chairman of Loxton District Council. He chaired
      the Hospital Board, the Institute Committee, the War Recruiting Committee,
      the Vermin Board and, from 1923, St Peters Lutheran Church Building
      Committee. Instrumental in bringing the railway, reticulated water and
      telephone services to Loxton, he built the first picture theatre and contributed
      to Loxton’s first dryland experimental farm,130 again on Drabsch land.
      				</p>
      				<p>
      Although he served the town with distinction until 1916, during WW1,
      his German heritage was misrepresented. He was heart-broken to be
      incarcerated in Holdsworthy Internment Camp for nearly three years. 
      				</p>
      				<p>
      				In
      1920, with no charge ever laid nor authority for his arrest determined, a
      Royal Commission in finding nothing against him, praised his <em><big>"undeniable
      service to Australia!"</big></em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    He soon returned to public life, but sadly these experiences had taken their
	  toll. He died on 6th May 1924 aged fifty eight, four days after his wife.
	  Drabsch Street has prominence in Loxton, a fitting memorial to <em>‘the Father of
	  Loxton’</em> and his brothers.
